# 🎯 Dynamic Personalization & Logging Script for Salesforce Marketing Cloud

## 📌 Overview
This AMPscript dynamically assigns targeted email content rules based on each subscriber's segment and logs key values to a Data Extension. It enables scalable personalization in Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) while capturing rich metadata for downstream reporting and revenue attribution.

---

## 🧩 The Problem It Solves
Our alumni and donor marketing team was managing 20+ unique audience segments for a major fundraising campaign, each requiring tailored content. Manually building separate emails or duplicating content blocks for each segment was inefficient and error-prone.

We needed a centralized, scalable solution to:
- Dynamically assign content rules based on `SegmentName`
- Log send-time details for each subscriber
- Build end-to-end visibility from content exposure to donation behavior

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. **Data Retrieval**
The script pulls metadata and subscriber attributes:
- `JobID`, `MailingID`, `MailingName`
- `SubscriberKey`, `SegmentName`, `SourceCode`, `FinderNumber`
- `Timestamp` (2 hours ahead for time zone alignment)

### 2. **Dynamic Content Assignment**
Using conditional AMPscript logic, it matches the `SegmentName` to a specific `DynamicContentRule` (a predefined template name).

```ampscript
IF @SegmentName == "COE - All Living Alumni" THEN
  SET @DynamicContentRule = "CDAG - FY25 - DDOG - Noon - MFECOE"
ENDIF
```

### 3. **Fallback Logic**
If no match is found, a default template is assigned:
```ampscript
SET @DynamicContentRule = "CDAG - FY25 - DDOG - SCUD Dynamic Content Template"
```

### 4. **Logging for Reporting**
A row is inserted into the `StagingSendLog` Data Extension for every email send. If key values required for logging are missing, the script uses `RaiseError` to prevent incomplete data from being recorded:

```ampscript
IF NOT EMPTY(@SubscriberKey) AND NOT EMPTY(@JobID) THEN
  InsertDE("StagingSendLog",
    "JobID", @JobID,
    "MailingID", @MailingID,
    "SubscriberKey", @SubscriberKey,
    "MailingName", @MailingName,
    "DynamicContentRule", @DynamicContentRule,
    "SourceCode", @SourceCode,
    "SegmentName", @SegmentName,
    "FinderNumber", @FinderNumber,
    "Timestamp", @Timestamp
  )
ELSE
  RaiseError("Missing required data for InsertDE function.", false)
ENDIF
```

This protects data integrity by ensuring each logged row contains essential identifiers for downstream analytics.

## 📊 Data Extension: Why It Matters

The `StagingSendLog` isn't just for debugging—it plays a **key role in analytics and revenue attribution**. By logging what dynamic content each subscriber received, we enabled:

- Post-campaign analysis of giving behavior by content type
- Segment-level engagement comparisons
- Integration with donation data for ROI tracking
- Creation of custom dashboards in Tableau or Power BI

> Each row in the Data Extension acts as a **receipt** for the personalized message delivered—paving the way for true performance measurement.
